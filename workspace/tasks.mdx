# Tasks

Bring order to your academic chaos with Cortex’s intuitive **Kanban board**.\
Track assignments, manage phases of research, and prioritize study time — all in one collaborative workspace.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Board Structure" icon="grid">
    Cortex Tasks are organized using a flexible Kanban layout:

    - Each **column** represents a stage in your workflow — like _To Do_, _In Progress_, or _Done_
    - **Cards** represent individual tasks, which can be moved between columns to reflect progress
    - Columns can be added, renamed, or deleted to match your preferred workflow

    <Tip>
      Use custom columns for different courses, group projects, or personal goals.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creating Tasks" icon="plus">
    You can add tasks directly from the board by clicking **"Add a card"** at the bottom of any column.

    Prefer keyboard?\
    Use the **Command Palette** (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`) to create tasks instantly from anywhere in the app.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Editing Task Details" icon="file">
    Click on any task card to open its full detail view. From there you can:

    - Edit the title and description
    - Set a due date and add tags
    - Assign the task to team members

    All edits are saved in real time — no need to refresh or sync manually.

# Tasks

Bring order to your academic chaos with Cortex's intuitive **Kanban board**.  
The Tasks view gives you a bird's-eye look at your workflow — perfect for tracking assignments, managing research phases, and prioritizing study time.

---

## Anatomy of the Task Board

### Columns  
Each column represents a stage of your process — like _To Do_, _In Progress_, or _Done_.

- Add, rename, or delete columns to fit your workflow.
- Tailor it for courses, projects, or personal goals.

### Cards  
Each task lives inside a card.

- Drag and drop between columns to update status.
- Changes sync instantly across your team.

---

## Working with Tasks

### Creating Tasks  
Click **"Add a card"** at the bottom of any column, or use the **Command Palette** (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`) to create tasks instantly from anywhere.

### Editing Details  
Click any task card to open its detail view:

- Set title and description  
- Assign a due date and tags  
- Delegate to team members

All updates are live and collaborative.

# Calendar

The Calendar view gives you a visual timeline of your work — in monthly, weekly, or daily formats.  
It’s the perfect way to stay on top of deadlines, milestones, and your team’s schedule.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Never Miss a Deadline" icon="calendar-check">
    The calendar automatically pulls in all tasks with due dates from the **Tasks** view.  
    This keeps everything synced without requiring extra setup — your schedule builds itself.
    
    <Tip>
      Add due dates to your tasks to keep your calendar fully populated.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quick Access to Task Details" icon="list">
    Click on any event in the calendar to open the task’s detail modal:
    
    - View full task info and descriptions  
    - See who’s assigned  
    - Edit status or change the due date — without leaving the calendar
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flexible Time Views" icon="clock">
    Switch between different calendar layouts:
    
    - **Month** view for a big-picture overview  
    - **Week** view for mid-range planning

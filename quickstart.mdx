## Get started

Understanding a few core concepts will help you get the most out of Cortex. Everything starts with a **Project** — your central hub for collaboration.

### Step 1: Create a Project

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="plus" title="Create a new project">
    From your Cortex dashboard, click the **"New Project"** button.  
    Enter a name for your project and hit **Create**.  
  
    Your workspace will instantly be set up with real-time tools like Tasks, Notes, Whiteboard, Chat, and more.
    
    <Tip>You can create as many projects as you like — one for each class, study group, or goal.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="layout-grid" title="Explore the project dashboard">
    Once inside a project, you'll see a sidebar with tabs:  
    - **Tasks**  
    - **Notes**  
    - **Whiteboard**  
    - **Chat**  
    - **Timer**  
    - **Calendar**

    Each feature is built for real-time collaboration and productivity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Invite your team

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Add collaborators">
    Click the **three dots** next to your project name and select **"Invite Members"**.  
    Enter your teammates' email addresses and send invites.

    They'll get instant access and can start collaborating with you immediately.
    
    <Tip>You can manage roles and permissions in project settings.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="link" title="Share access securely">
    Cortex generates secure invite links so your collaborators can join without creating an account first.  

    You can revoke or expire invite links anytime from the project’s member panel.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Collaborate in real time

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Start working together">
  You're all set!  
  Open any feature tab — like Notes or Whiteboard — and collaborate with your team live. Changes sync instantly across all devices.

  <Tip>Use the built-in Chat and Timer to stay focused and in sync during sessions.</Tip>
</Accordion>

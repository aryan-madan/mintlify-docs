## Get started

Understanding a few core concepts will help you get the most out of Cortex. Everything starts with a **Project** — your central hub for collaboration.

### Step 1: Create a Project

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a new project" icon="plus">
    From your Cortex dashboard, click the **"New Project"** button.\
    Enter a name for your project and hit **Create**.

    Your workspace will instantly be set up with real-time tools like Tasks, Notes, Whiteboard, Chat, and more.

    <Tip>
      You can create as many projects as you like — one for each class, study group, or goal.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Explore the project dashboard" icon="grid">
    Once inside a project, you'll see a sidebar with tabs:

    - **Tasks**
    - **Notes**
    - **Whiteboard**
    - **Chat**
    - **Timer**
    - **Calendar**

    Each feature is built for real-time collaboration and productivity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Invite your team

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add collaborators" icon="users">
    Click the **three dots** next to your project name and select **"Members"**.\
    This will open a members panel with a **"Invite Members" **button.\
    Enter your teammates' email addresses and send invites.

    They'll get instant access and can start collaborating with you immediately after accepting your invite.

    <Tip>
      You can manage roles and permissions in project settings.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
<Accordion title="Share access securely" icon="link">
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <div>
      <p className="font-semibold">Owner</p>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        Has full control over the project, including the ability to delete it. Can manage all member roles.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p className="font-semibold">Admin</p>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        Can manage project settings and members (except for promoting others to Owner or removing an Owner).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p className="font-semibold">Editor</p>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        Can create and edit all project content (tasks, notes, chat messages, etc.). This is the standard role for team members.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p className="font-semibold">Viewer</p>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        Can view all project content but cannot make any changes. Perfect for stakeholders or advisors.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Collaborate in real time

<Accordion title="Start working together" icon="rocket">
  You're all set\!\
  Open any feature tab — like Notes or Whiteboard — and collaborate with your team live. Changes sync instantly across all devices.

  <Tip>
    Use the built-in Chat and Timer to stay focused and in sync during sessions.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Natural Language Commands" icon="sparkles">
    Just type what you want to do. Cortex understands natural phrasing and handles the rest:
    
    - _"Create a task to read chapter 5 and another to write the summary"_  
    - _"Start a new note titled 'Quantum Mechanics Outline'"_  
    - _"Plan my study schedule for finals next week, with a review session on Tuesday"_
    
    <Tip>
      You can combine multiple actions in a single command to move faster.
    </Tip>

  <Accordion title="Direct Commands & Navigation" icon="terminal">
    For precision, use direct syntax:
    
    - **Navigation**: Type any view name (e.g., `"Notes"`, `"Tasks"`) to instantly jump there  
    - **Tasks**: `task: Finish lab report`  
    - **Notes**: `note: Meeting recap`  
    - **Events**: `event: Math exam 2024-10-25`
    
    Ideal when you know exactly what you need to do.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Open with a Shortcut" icon="keyboard">
    You can launch the Command Palette from anywhere:
    
    - **⌘K** on macOS  
    - **Ctrl+K** on Windows
    
    It’s always just a keystroke away — no need to click through menus.
